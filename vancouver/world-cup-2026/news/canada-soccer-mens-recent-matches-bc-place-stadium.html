                <h2>Match Analysis & Key Trends</h2>
                <p>Looking at the recent history, BC Place has become a fortress for the Canadian team. The data reveals
                    three key trends:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>🔥 Dominant Offense:</strong> The massive <strong>6–0 win vs Honduras</strong> (2025)
                        and <strong>4–0 vs Curaçao</strong> (2022) prove Canada's ability to control games and score
                        heavily at home.</li>
                    <li><strong>🏟️ The "Cancelled" Era:</strong> The 2022 cancellations (Iran/Panama) only increased
                        the hunger of local fans, making every subsequent match even more electric.</li>
                    <li><strong>📈 Upward Trajectory:</strong> From the 4–1 win over French Guiana (2019) to the recent
                        Gold Cup thrashing, the team's performance at BC Place has consistently improved leading up to
                        2026.</li>
                </ul>
