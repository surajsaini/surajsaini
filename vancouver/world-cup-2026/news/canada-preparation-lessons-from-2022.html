                <p>The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be a historic moment for Canada. For the first time, the country will
                    co-host the tournament alongside the United States and Mexico. While Canada qualified for the 2022
                    World Cup in Qatar, the team faced a steep learning curve. To succeed on home soil in 2026, the
                    national team is focusing on specific lessons learned from their last performance.</p>

                <h2>A Recap of Canada at the 2022 World Cup</h2>
                <p>In 2022, Canada was placed in Group F. Despite high energy and flashes of brilliance, the team lost
                    all three group-stage matches.</p>

                <table class="roster-table">
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Match Date</th>
                            <th>Opponent</th>
                            <th>Result</th>
                            <th>Canadian Goal Scorer</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Nov 23, 2022</td>
                            <td>Belgium</td>
                            <td>1–0 (Loss)</td>
                            <td>None</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Nov 27, 2022</td>
                            <td>Croatia</td>
                            <td>4–1 (Loss)</td>
                            <td>Alphonso Davies</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Dec 1, 2022</td>
                            <td>Morocco</td>
                            <td>1–2 (Loss)</td>
                            <td>Own Goal (Nayef Aguerd)</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <p>The team was led by coach John Herdman. While they did not earn any points, the tournament provided a
                    foundation for future growth.</p>

                <h2>Key Lessons from the 2022 World Cup</h2>
                <p>For Canada to reach the knockout stages in 2026, several areas of the game require improvement.</p>

                <h3>1. Converting Chances into Goals</h3>
                <p>In 2022, Canada proved they could create opportunities. In their opening match against Belgium, they
                    had 22 shots but failed to score. At the World Cup level, efficiency is vital.</p>
                <p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> Players must improve their finishing skills and stay calm under
                    pressure.</p>
                <p><strong>The Progress:</strong> Under current coach Jesse Marsch, the team is working on a more
                    pragmatic attacking system to ensure high-quality scoring chances.</p>

                <h3>2. Defensive Discipline and Coordination</h3>
                <p>The 2022 matches against Croatia and Morocco showed that defensive errors are punished quickly.
                    Canada's aggressive high-press style left gaps that experienced teams exploited.</p>
                <p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> Better positioning and defensive marking are necessary when playing
                    against world-class midfielders and strikers.</p>
                <p><strong>The Progress:</strong> Canada's performance in the 2024 Copa America, where they finished
                    4th, showed a much more disciplined defensive structure.</p>

                <h3>3. Building Roster Depth</h3>
                <p>In Qatar, Canada relied heavily on a small group of star players like Alphonso Davies and Jonathan
                    David. By the third match, fatigue was a visible factor.</p>
                <p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> A successful tournament run requires 26 capable players, not just a
                    strong starting eleven.</p>
                <p><strong>The Progress:</strong> New talents like Moïse Bombito and Ismaël Koné have emerged, giving
                    the squad more options and "tournament legs."</p>

                <h3>4. Managing Game Momentum</h3>
                <p>Canada often played with extreme speed and energy but struggled to control the tempo of the game.</p>
                <p><strong>The Lesson:</strong> The team needs to learn when to slow the game down and keep possession
                    to frustrate the opponent.</p>

                <h2>How Canada is Preparing for 2026</h2>
                <p>The preparation for 2026 is already well underway. Canada has been placed in Group B for the 2026
                    tournament, where they will face Switzerland, Qatar, and a European Play-Off winner.</p>
                <p><strong>Coaching Stability:</strong> Jesse Marsch has shifted the team's culture toward a "two
                    players deep" philosophy at every position.</p>
                <p><strong>Home Field Advantage:</strong> Canada will play its group matches in Toronto and Vancouver.
                    This eliminates long-distance travel and allows the team to play in front of a supportive local
                    crowd.</p>
                <p><strong>High-Level Experience:</strong> By participating in the Copa America and scheduling
                    friendlies against top-ranked nations, the players are gaining the "big match" experience they
                    lacked in 2022.</p>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>The 2022 World Cup was a necessary "welcome back" for Canada soccer. The losses in Qatar were not
                    failures, but rather a roadmap for what needs to change. With improved defense, better finishing,
                    and the advantage of playing at home, Canada is positioned to make a much deeper run in 2026.</p>
