                <p>The official final roster for the Canadian men's national soccer team for the FIFA World Cup 2026™
                    has not been announced yet. The tournament is still over six months away, with the first match in
                    Canada set for June 12, 2026, in Toronto, and games in Vancouver, BC, starting shortly after.</p>

                <p>Head coach Jesse Marsch and his staff are actively evaluating players through camps and friendly
                    matches. FIFA rules require a provisional roster of 35-55 players to be submitted first, followed by
                    the final 26-man squad closer to the tournament kickoff.</p>

                <h2>Vancouver's Role in World Cup 2026</h2>
                <p>Vancouver will be a central hub for the tournament, hosting seven matches at BC Place stadium,
                    including two of Canada's group stage games.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Thursday, June 18, 2026:</strong> Canada vs. Qatar</li>
                    <li><strong>Wednesday, June 24, 2026:</strong> Switzerland vs. Canada</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Fans in Vancouver are eagerly awaiting the opportunity to cheer on the national team on home soil.
                    The city is focusing on refining logistics like safety, security, and traffic plans for the massive
                    influx of visitors.</p>

                <h2>Latest Roster Insights</h2>
                <p>While the final squad is not set, recent call-ups and expert analysis give a strong indication of who
                    might make the team. Key players like Alphonso Davies (Bayern Munich) and Jonathan David (Juventus)
                    are considered locks for the roster, as are Vancouver Whitecaps FC players like Ali Ahmed and Jayden
                    Nelson.</p>

                <p>Coach Marsch has been utilizing recent friendlies to review depth, especially in defensive positions
                    where key players have dealt with injuries. The upcoming January 2026 training camp for North
                    American-based players will be another crucial opportunity for players to impress the coaching
                    staff.</p>

                <p>The excitement is building as Canada prepares to host and compete in the World Cup for only the
                    second time in history.</p>

                <h2>Latest Squad Selection (November 2025)</h2>
                <p>The following players were called up for the most recent matches against Ecuador and Venezuela,
                    providing an indication of likely selections for the final World Cup roster:</p>
