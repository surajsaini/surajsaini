            <h1>Mayoral Race Heating Up: Councillor Pete Fry Teases Official Campaign Launch</h1>

            <p class="article-meta">Published: January 22, 2026</p>

            <section class="article-content">
                <h2>A New Challenger for Mayor? Pete Fry Announces Upcoming "Launch Party"</h2>
                <p>The political landscape in Vancouver is shifting today as long-time City Councillor Pete Fry has
                    officially signaled a major announcement. While the Green Party councillor has not yet explicitly
                    confirmed his bid for the mayor’s chair, he has invited supporters to a "launch party" scheduled for
                    Friday, January 30, 2026.</p>

                <p>This move comes after months of speculation and Fry’s own admission late last year that he was
                    "seriously considering" a run for the city's top job.</p>

                <h2>Why This Matters for the 2026 Election</h2>
                <p>As the lone Green Party voice on council, Fry has established himself as a prominent critic of <a
                        href="../index.html">Mayor Ken Sim</a> and the ABC Vancouver majority. His potential entry into
                    the race could unify progressive voters who are looking for an alternative to the current
                    administration’s "public safety first" and "back-to-basics" agenda.</p>

                <p>Key developments leading to this announcement:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Uniting the Left:</strong> Political analysts suggest Fry could be the candidate to
                        bridge the gap between Vancouver’s various progressive parties, including COPE and OneCity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Focus on Integrity:</strong> Fry has been a vocal advocate for transparency at City
                        Hall, recently pushing for reforms to the code of conduct and criticizing the private meetings
                        held by the current council majority.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tenant Protections:</strong> Just this week, Fry successfully moved a motion to explore
                        tougher licensing for landlords to protect renters from "bad faith" evictions and unsafe living
                        conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>The "Reply Guy" Factor:</strong> Known for his detailed critiques of ABC
                        policies—ranging from the abolishment of the Park Board to the exploration of Bitcoin—Fry has
                        built significant name recognition as the primary opposition voice.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Competition</h2>
                <p>If Fry officially declares his candidacy, he will join a growing field of challengers looking to
                    unseat Mayor Ken Sim. Other potential or confirmed contenders include former ABC Councillor Rebecca
                    Bligh and Sim’s former Chief of Staff Kareem Allam.</p>

                <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
                <p>The official "launch" next Friday is expected to provide clarity on Fry's platform and whether he
                    will run under the Green Party banner or as part of a broader progressive coalition.</p>

                <p>Residents interested in the future of Vancouver’s housing, climate policy, and government
                    transparency will be watching closely as the 2026 municipal election cycle begins to take shape.</p>
