            <h1>2026 Vancouver Election: Scott Jensen Joins New Vancouver Liberal Party</h1>

            <p class="article-meta">Published: January 19, 2026</p>

            <section class="article-content">
                <p>VANCOUVER, BC – The race for the 2026 Vancouver municipal election is heating up as sitting Park Board Commissioner Scott Jensen officially joins the newly formed Vancouver Liberal Party.</p>

                <p>Jensen, who was originally elected with the ABC Vancouver party in 2022, will seek re-election under the leadership of Kareem Allam. Allam, a former chief of staff to Mayor Ken Sim, launched the Vancouver Liberals to offer a "big-tent" alternative for local voters.</p>

                <h2>Why the Move Matters for Vancouver Voters</h2>
                <p>The shift comes after a major political split in late 2023. Jensen, along with fellow commissioners, broke away from ABC Vancouver after Mayor Ken Sim announced plans to abolish the elected Park Board.</p>

                <p>Jensen has been a vocal supporter of keeping the Park Board independent, arguing that it protects the city’s green spaces and community centers. By joining the Vancouver Liberals, Jensen aims to continue his work on the board and keep "local democracy" alive in Vancouver’s parks.</p>

                <h2>Key Highlights:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>New Political Party:</strong> The Vancouver Liberal Party is positioning itself as a major challenger to the current ABC Vancouver majority.</li>
                    <li><strong>Focus on Parks:</strong> A central issue for the 2026 election will be the future of the Vancouver Park Board.</li>
                    <li><strong>Experienced Leadership:</strong> Kareem Allam calls Jensen’s move a "major win" for the upstart party as they look to recruit more independent incumbents.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
                <p>As Vancouver prepares for the October 2026 election, residents can expect more debates regarding city governance, park management, and the best way to run the city's unique park system.</p>

                <p>Whether you are a local resident or a visitor enjoying Stanley Park, the outcome of this election will decide who manages the city's world-famous outdoor spaces.</p>
