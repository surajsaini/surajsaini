                <h2>Overview and Total Cost Estimates</h2>
                <p>Vancouver is one of the proud cities selected to host FIFA World Cup 2026 matches, welcoming soccer
                    fans from around the globe to beautiful Metro Vancouver, British Columbia. While this international
                    event brings excitement and global attention, the cost of Vancouver hosting the World Cup 2026 has
                    become a major topic of discussion among locals, media, and business owners. According to the B.C.
                    government, the total cost for Vancouver and surrounding services to host seven matches is now
                    estimated between $532 million and $624 million Canadian dollars. This includes planning, security,
                    transportation, and necessary upgrades to facilities such as BC Place Stadium.

                <h2>Infrastructure and Essential Services</h2>
                <p>A significant portion of these costs comes from essential services and infrastructure. The City of
                    Vancouver budget now includes funds for safety, transit coordination, medical services, and the FIFA
                    Fan Festival. Meanwhile, PavCo the Crown corporation that runs BC Place is investing in major
                    improvements like playing surface changes and other FIFA-required upgrades. These enhancements are
                    necessary not only for the World Cup, but they may also benefit Vancouver's sports and entertainment
                    calendar for years to come.

                <h2>Economic Benefits</h2>
                <p>Despite the high costs, city and provincial officials argue that hosting World Cup matches will
                    deliver strong economic benefits for Vancouver. Tourism agencies predict that the event could
                    generate over $1 billion in visitor spending and bring millions of new visitors to local hotels,
                    restaurants, and attractions. There's also the long-term benefit of increased global visibility for
                    Vancouver tourism and business, helping local brands stay competitive on the international stage.

                <h2>Local Perspectives</h2>
                <p>Local opinions in Vancouver are mixed, as residents balance excitement with concerns about public
                    spending. Some polls indicate that many people want to see the city at least break even or profit
                    from hosting, while others feel the price tag may outweigh the benefits. Regardless of views, this
                    debate highlights the importance of transparent planning, clear financial reporting, and community
                    involvement as Vancouver prepares for the FIFA World Cup 2026.
