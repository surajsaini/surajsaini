            <p class="article-meta">Published: January 22, 2026</p>

            <section class="article-content">
                <h2>Vancouver City Council Hits "Zero" with 2026 Municipal Budget</h2>
                <p>In a landmark move for local affordability, <a href="../index.html">Vancouver City Council</a> has
                    officially approved the 2026
                    Municipal Budget, headlined by a 0% property tax increase. Mayor Ken Sim’s "Zero Means Zero"
                    strategy aims to provide direct financial relief to residents and small businesses facing high
                    inflation and housing costs.</p>

                <h2>What the 2026 Budget Means for Your Wallet</h2>
                <p>While the property tax freeze is the headline, the $2.39 billion operating plan involves significant
                    shifts in how city funds are collected and spent:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Utility Fee Adjustments:</strong> To balance the freeze on property taxes, utility fees
                        for water, sewer, and solid waste will rise by an average of 4.2%. For a median single-family
                        home, this equates to roughly $107 per year.</li>
                    <li><strong>Public Safety First:</strong> The Vancouver Police Department (VPD) will see a $50
                        million funding increase, alongside a 6% boost for Fire and Rescue services.</li>
                    <li><strong>Back-to-Basics Infrastructure:</strong> The $894 million capital budget prioritizes core
                        assets, including seismic upgrades for the Cambie Bridge, the new PNE Amphitheatre, and the
                        Marpole Community Centre.</li>
                    <li><strong>Departmental Reductions:</strong> To achieve the tax freeze, the city is scaling back
                        spending in non-core areas. The Planning, Urban Design, and Sustainability department faces a
                        14% cut, while Arts & Culture funding will see a 12% reduction.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Trade-off: Core Services vs. Community Programs</h2>
                <p>The 2026 budget marks a clear ideological shift toward "essential services." While homeowners will
                    appreciate the tax relief, community advocates have raised concerns about the impact of cuts to
                    climate initiatives and the arts. City Council maintains that this "leaner" approach is necessary to
                    ensure the city remains affordable for the average family.</p>

                <h2>Important Dates for Residents</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Late January 2026:</strong> Final detailed budget documents will be available on the
                        City of Vancouver website.</li>
                    <li><strong>May 2026:</strong> Property tax notices are mailed out to all registered owners.</li>
                    <li><strong>Early July 2026:</strong> Deadline for property tax and utility fee payments.</li>
                </ul>
