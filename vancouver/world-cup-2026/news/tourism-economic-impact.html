                <p>Vancouver is getting ready for a massive transformation. With BC Place Stadium confirmed to host
                    seven matches of the FIFA World Cup 2026, the city is preparing for a record-breaking wave of
                    tourism.</p>

                <p>This global football event is not just about soccer. It is a huge economic opportunity that will
                    shape Vancouver’s tourism, jobs, and global image for many years.</p>

                <h2>The Massive Economic Boost</h2>

                <p>The Province of British Columbia estimates a $1.7 billion boost to the local economy during the World
                    Cup period. This economic growth will benefit many sectors across the city.</p>

                <h2>Key Economic Benefits</h2>

                <p>Dining and Retail: Restaurants, cafés, pubs, and shopping areas will see a big increase in customers.
                </p>

                <p>Job Creation: The event is expected to support more than 18,000 jobs, especially in tourism, hotels,
                    transport, and event services.</p>

                <p>International Tourism: Over 350,000 international visitors are expected to visit Vancouver mainly to
                    attend World Cup matches.</p>

                <p>Small Businesses: Local tour operators, souvenir shops, and service providers will see higher demand.
                </p>

                <h2>Long-Term Tourism Growth for Vancouver</h2>

                <p>The impact of the World Cup will not end in 2026. Tourism experts say that first-time visitors to
                    British Columbia often return at least four times in their lifetime.</p>

                <p>By showing Vancouver on a global stage, the city will gain:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Stronger global brand recognition</li>
                    <li>Higher future tourism bookings</li>
                    <li>More international events and conferences</li>
                    <li>Increased investment in hospitality and infrastructure</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This makes the World Cup a long-term investment, not just a short-term event.</p>
