            <h1>Vancouver Election 2026: William Azaroff Emerges as OneCity Mayoral Candidate Amid Progressive Strategy
                to Avoid Vote Splitting</h1>

            <p class="article-meta">Published: December 19, 2025</p>

            <section class="article-content">
                <p>As the October 2026 municipal election draws closer, the political landscape in Vancouver is already
                    heating up. With the lessons of the 2022 landslide victory by Mayor Ken Sim and ABC Vancouver still
                    fresh, progressive parties are beginning to mobilize. Two major developments are currently shaping
                    the narrative: the early nomination of William Azaroff as the mayoral candidate for OneCity, and a
                    growing movement to prevent a "vote split" that could hand ABC a second term.</p>

                <h2>OneCity Fields William Azaroff to Tackle Housing and Affordability</h2>
                <p>In a move to build early momentum, OneCity Vancouver has officially nominated William Azaroff to run
                    for Mayor in 2026. Azaroff, a well-known figure in Vancouver’s non-profit and financial sectors,
                    currently serves as the CEO of Brightside Community Homes Foundation and formerly held executive
                    roles at Vancity.</p>

                <p>Azaroff’s campaign is expected to center on the city’s most pressing issues: housing affordability,
                    climate action, and social equity. By positioning a leader with deep roots in community housing
                    early in the cycle, OneCity aims to present a credible, professional alternative to the current
                    administration. Azaroff has already begun "building support" across the city, focusing on a vision
                    of a more inclusive and affordable Vancouver.</p>

                <h2>The "Vote Split" Dilemma: Can the Progressives Unite?</h2>
                <p>While Azaroff’s candidacy brings a fresh face to the race, local political analysts are raising
                    alarms about the potential for a "progressive vote split." In the 2022 election, the fragmented
                    field of left-leaning and center-left parties—including Forward Vancouver, OneCity, the Greens, and
                    COPE—allowed Ken Sim and his ABC Vancouver party to secure a dominant majority.</p>

                <p>Recent reports from CBC highlight that discussions are already happening behind the scenes to avoid a
                    repeat of 2022. The core question for 2026 is whether these various factions can rally behind a
                    single mayoral candidate or form a strategic alliance. If multiple high-profile progressive
                    candidates enter the race, there is a significant risk that they will cancel each other out,
                    clearing a path for an ABC Vancouver repeat.</p>

                <h2>What This Means for Vancouver Voters in 2026</h2>
                <p>The 2026 election will likely be a referendum on Mayor Ken Sim’s "tough on crime" and "pro-growth"
                    agenda. For voters, the emergence of William Azaroff signals that the opposition is ready to
                    challenge the status quo with a focus on social infrastructure. However, the success of his
                    campaign—or any challenger’s campaign—will depend heavily on whether the progressive side of the
                    ballot remains divided or finds a way to consolidate.</p>

                <h3>Key Themes to Watch:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Housing Policy:</strong> How Azaroff’s experience at Brightside will contrast with ABC’s
                        development-heavy approach.</li>
                    <li><strong>Coalition Building:</strong> Whether the Greens and other parties will endorse a single
                        candidate or field their own.</li>
                    <li><strong>Public Safety and Services:</strong> The ongoing debate over police funding versus
                        social services.</li>
                </ul>
