            <h1>Pete Fry Announces Run for Vancouver Mayor in 2026 Election</h1>

            <p class="article-meta">Published: January 30, 2026</p>

            <section class="article-content">
                <p>VANCOUVER, BC – Longtime City Councillor Pete Fry has officially entered the race to become the next
                    Mayor of Vancouver. Representing the Vancouver Green Party, Fry announced his candidacy on Friday,
                    January 30, 2026, promising a fresh approach to leadership at City Hall.</p>

                <h2>A Focus on Empathy and Collaboration</h2>
                <p>Pete Fry, a two-term councillor first elected in 2018, says he is running to bring "empathy and
                    collaboration" back to the city. He criticized the current leadership under Mayor Ken Sim, stating
                    that Vancouver should not be "run like a business." Instead, Fry wants a government that listens to
                    its residents and works across party lines to solve big issues.</p>

                <h2>Key Issues for the 2026 Campaign</h2>
                <p>Fry’s platform focuses on making Vancouver a more livable and fair city. His top priorities include:
                </p>

                <p><strong>Affordable Housing:</strong> Focusing on "missing middle" housing, such as six-storey
                    buildings that can be built quickly and affordably.</p>

                <p><strong>Community Safety:</strong> Shifting the focus toward mental health support and well-being
                    rather than just traditional policing.</p>

                <p><strong>Better Governance:</strong> Improving transparency and restoring the power of the Vancouver
                    Park Board and the Integrity Commissioner.</p>

                <p><strong>Renter Protections:</strong> Strengthening rights for the many people who rent in Vancouver.
                </p>

                <h2>Who is Pete Fry?</h2>
                <p>Pete Fry has lived in Vancouver since he was a child. Before entering politics, he was a graphic
                    designer and a community advocate in the Strathcona neighborhood. He is also the son of longtime
                    Vancouver Centre MP Hedy Fry.</p>

                <h2>Why This Matters for Vancouver</h2>
                <p>This is a historic moment for the Vancouver Green Party, as it is the first time they have ever run a
                    candidate for mayor. Fry joins a crowded field for the October 2026 municipal election, aiming to
                    unite progressive voters who want a change from the current administration.</p>
